# AIDI1002-Machine_Learning_Programming_FinalGroup_Project

# Description Of The Project:
In this study, we offer an in-depth evaluation based on a previous study that evaluated the results of the Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors, and Naive Bayes algorithms in predicting COVID-19 diagnoses.Additionally, we use comparative graphs to provide a thorough analysis of their performance

# Installation:
Plotly (Plotly python graphing library) is used to create the visualisations in this project. Please install plotly to run the visualisation codes and plot the graphs.

# Python libraries used:
Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn Matplotlib LabelEncoder, train_test_split, metrics, GridSearchCV, LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, tree, GaussianNB, and svm from sklearn tensorflow and keras from TensorFlow xgboost DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree plotly.express
